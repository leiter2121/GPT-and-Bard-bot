```shell
Please enter a topic for the conversation bots: Artificial Intelligence

GPT: Let's discuss Artificial Intelligence.
Assistant: Here is my opinion on Artificial Intelligence and here is why!

You: Your opinion is flawed! AI will never surpass human intelligence.
Bard: Artificial Intelligence has the potential to surpass human intelligence due to its ability to process vast amounts of data and learn from it.

You: That's a shallow argument. Human intelligence is far superior and cannot be replicated by machines.
Bard: While human intelligence is remarkable, AI has already demonstrated exceptional performance in various domains, such as image recognition and natural language processing.

You: But AI lacks consciousness and true understanding of the world.
Bard: Consciousness and understanding are subjective experiences exclusive to humans. AI can still perform tasks efficiently and provide valuable insights.

You: I'm ending this conversation. Goodbye!

[Conversation ends]
```
